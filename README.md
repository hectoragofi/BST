# BST
> basic stock tracker.

BST is a very basic stock tracker that i am going to slowly devlop and expand, hopefully making it useful. It uses BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape stock data from yahoo finance and Rich to make the interface

## Notes

- This is not meant to be used for anything professional as data may not be reliable
- The requests system should not be abused, because it will get your ip blocked on the yahoo finance site.

***

## Running

OS X & Linux & Windows: 
*compatibility has not been tested for linux and OS X but it should work*

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/hectoragofi/BST.git"
cd "put path of cloned project"
python bst.py
```
